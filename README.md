# should-i-buy-this-one
My first project involving Django, Docker, and a web scraper.
This web app takes in a search item and query parameters and then searches google shopping results.
It then scrapes/filters based on the userâ€™s preferences.
Originally deployed to AWS EC2 with a docker image.
Currently deployed to a Heroku dyno with a docker image.
